**[file: pom.xml | line 8]**
**[minor]** Spring Boot 2.1.4.RELEASE is from 2019 and while it supports Java 11, consider if a newer version would be beneficial for long-term maintenance.
**Why**: Newer Spring Boot versions provide better Java 11+ support, security updates, and feature improvements.
**Suggestion**: Consider upgrading to a more recent Spring Boot 2.x version that maintains compatibility while providing better Java 11 support.
