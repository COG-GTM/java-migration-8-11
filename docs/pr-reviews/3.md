# PR Review Log 3

## Summary
- Scope: Migrate banking application from Java 8 to Java 11 by updating Maven configuration and documentation
- Risk: Low (configuration-only changes, no code logic modified)
- Positives: Clean migration approach, consistent updates across pom.xml and README.md, proper Maven compiler plugin configuration
- Concerns: Minor version and compatibility considerations (see inline comments below)

## Inline Comments

**[file: pom.xml | line 87]**
**[minor]** Maven compiler plugin version 3.8.1 is outdated for Java 11 projects.
**Why**: Version 3.8.1 was released in 2019. Newer versions (3.11.0+) provide better Java 11+ support and bug fixes.
**Suggestion**:
```xml
<version>3.11.0</version>
```

**[file: pom.xml | lines 19-20]**
**[nit]** Redundant Maven compiler properties when using explicit plugin configuration.
**Why**: The maven.compiler.source and maven.compiler.target properties are redundant since the maven-compiler-plugin explicitly sets source and target to 11.
**Suggestion**: Consider removing lines 19-20 as the plugin configuration (lines 89-90) takes precedence.

**[file: pom.xml | line 8]**
**[major]** Spring Boot 2.1.4 compatibility with Java 11 should be verified.
**Why**: Spring Boot 2.1.4 was released in 2019 and while it supports Java 11, newer versions provide better Java 11+ optimizations and security updates.
**Suggestion**: Consider upgrading to Spring Boot 2.7.x (latest 2.x) or evaluate migration to 3.x for better Java 11+ support, though this would be a larger scope change.

**[file: pom.xml | lines 58-64]**
**[minor]** Springfox Swagger dependencies may have Java 11 compatibility issues.
**Why**: Springfox 2.9.2 is quite old and may have reflection-related issues with Java 11's module system. The base branch shows a dependabot update to 2.10.0 which is better but still outdated.
**Suggestion**: Consider migrating to SpringDoc OpenAPI 3 for better Java 11+ support and active maintenance.

## Decision
Comment

## Next Steps
1. Verify the application compiles and runs successfully with Java 11
2. Test all API endpoints to ensure no runtime issues with Java 11
3. Consider updating Maven compiler plugin to 3.11.0 for better Java 11 support
4. Evaluate Spring Boot and Swagger dependency updates for better Java 11 compatibility
5. Run comprehensive integration tests to validate the migration
